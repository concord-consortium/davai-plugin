# AI Assistant Settings

This is a repository of AI assistant settings values for which we want simple version control. The settings values are currently entered and saved at platform.openai.com.

## Directory Structure

Each assistant in the DAVAI project has its own subdirectory containing text files for each specific setting we track. For example, instructions.txt is for the assistant's Instructions setting value.

## Workflow

Since non-developers can modify settings but are unlikely to update this repository, developers should follow these steps to ensure the repository stays reasonably up-to-date:

1. Before making changes, copy the value(s) from platform.openai.com and commit any changes not already recorded here.
2. Make your changes on platform.openai.com, then update the corresponding files here and commit the changes.
