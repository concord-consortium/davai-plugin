# DAVAI Server

This directory contains the Express-based server for the DAVAI plugin, deployed via AWS Lambda using `@vendia/serverless-express`.

## Development

To run the server locally, make sure you are in the `server` directory, run `npm install`, and then `npm start`.

## Deployment

Deployment involves manually uploading the zipped server files to AWS Lambda. This will likely change as we move forward with using LangChain.
